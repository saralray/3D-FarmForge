# Go web/api port — roadmap

Porting the Node `web` service (`server/app.js` ~5.5k lines + `server/postgres.js`
~2.1k lines + support modules) to Go (`go-services/cmd/web`). The exporter and
poller are already ported and verified. This is a multi-session effort; the Node
service stays the live `web` container until the Go one reaches full parity — the
Go server is brought up on a **separate port** for parity testing and only swapped
into compose at the end.

## Verification strategy

Run Go `web` on an alt port against the live DB; for each endpoint group, diff Go
vs Node JSON (status, headers, body) with the same requests. `API.md` is the
authoritative contract — keep it in sync. Cut over in compose only after the full
matrix passes and the dashboard renders against the Go server with no console
errors.

## Module layout (planned)

```
go-services/
  internal/
    db/        pgxpool (shared); reuse + add pool
    secretcrypto/  (done) AES-GCM printer secrets
    metrics/   (done, exporter) — web gets its own printfarm_web_* writer
    redis/     optional sessions/ratelimit/telemetry cache (go-redis)
    pwcrypto/  scrypt + legacy sha256 verify/upgrade
    saml/      SAML SP: metadata, ACS, signed-assertion verify (xml-c14n + dsig)
  cmd/web/
    main.go        server, signal handling
    router.go      top-level dispatch (mirrors app.js)
    auth.go        session resolve, classifyApiRequest, CSRF origin check, roles
    security.go    setSecurityHeaders (CSP/HSTS/etc), logger, X-Request-Id
    metrics.go     printfarm_web_* (port of server/metrics.js)
    store/         port of server/postgres.js (70 fns) — grouped by resource
    printers.go    /api/printers, redaction, /command (MQTT), proxy
    queue.go       /api/queue + submit (busboy→multipart), file stream
    analytics.go   /api/analytics/daily
    maintenance.go /api/maintenance/*
    notifications.go, slicerkeys.go, auditlogs.go, settings.go, users.go
    admincred.go, manager.go
    camera.go      Bambu camera hub (port of bambuCamera.js + captureBambuSnapshot)
    proxy.go       /__printer_proxy, /__printer_webcam (handlePrinterProxy)
    dataapi.go     /api/v1 (handleDataApi*) — key-gated, full read/write
    auth_sso.go    /api/auth/* providers, oauth, SAML
```

## Status

- **Phase 1 — done & verified.** Foundation at full parity (commit "web Go port phase 1").
- **Phase 2 — done & verified** for the polled data reads + on-load settings reads
  (`GET /api/printers`, `/api/printers/:id`, `/api/queue`, `/api/analytics/daily`,
  `/api/cameras/health`, `/api/printers/:id/camera/health`, `/api/settings/{branding,
  integrations,public-viewer,analytics-layout,printer-card-layout/:profile}`). Byte-
  identical body + headers vs the live Node server across the matrix above. The
  **maintenance reads** (`/api/maintenance*`, `/api/printers/:id/maintenance`,
  `/api/settings/maintenance-intervals`) are split out as **Phase 2b** (still TODO).
  Key parity mechanism: `jsCompact` re-serializes Postgres `json` output the way
  Node's `JSON.parse`→`JSON.stringify` does (compact, JS-normalized numbers,
  preserved key order); ordered structs reproduce object-literal key order where Go
  maps would sort. The privileged (full-secrets) printer path is stubbed off until
  sessions land in Phase 3 — every caller is currently treated as anonymous/redacted.
- **Phase 2b — done & verified.** Maintenance reads at parity (`GET /api/maintenance`,
  `/api/maintenance/summary`, `/api/maintenance/notifications`, `/api/printers/:id/
  maintenance`, `/api/settings/maintenance-intervals`). Unlike the json_build_object
  reads, the Node maintenance fns return raw `pg` rows, so timestamptz arrives as a JS
  `Date` and is emitted via `toISOString()` (ms + `Z`). The Go port scans typed columns
  and formats with `jsISO`, verified byte-identical to `Date.toISOString()` including
  sub-ms truncation (node-postgres floors micros→ms). `getPrinterMaintenance`'s
  next-service / overdue / health-score computation is reproduced in Go with the same
  float arithmetic. Mutations (mark-read, complete, intervals PUT) remain Phase 4.
- **Phase 3 — done & verified.** Sessions & auth: cookie parse/issue (`pf_session`,
  SameSite=Lax), `internal/pwcrypto` (scrypt derive/verify + legacy sha256, wire
  format identical to app.js), session DB store, the default-deny gate
  (`authorizeFrontendApi` / `classifyApiRequest` / `isSensitiveRead` / admin/operator
  matrices) + CSRF same-origin check, and the endpoints `GET /api/auth/{session,
  providers}`, `POST /api/auth/{login,logout}`, `GET|POST|PUT /api/admin/credential`,
  `POST /api/admin/credential/verify`, `POST /api/users/verify`. `isPrivileged(session)`
  now drives the full-secrets printer path. Verified two ways: (1) the 20-case gate
  matrix (401/403/public, CSRF) byte-identical vs the live Node server; (2) a full
  happy-path flow (login → session → privileged unredacted printers → logout →
  re-redaction) byte-identical vs Node on a throwaway DB — incl. an admin credential
  set as scrypt by Node and verified by Go (cross-runtime KDF compatibility). Redis
  session caching + login throttle are omitted (disabled deployment; Node falls back
  to the same Postgres path). Remaining: SSO grant `/api/auth/verify`, slicer-token,
  and the SAML endpoints (Phase 8).
- **Phase 4 — done & verified.** Operator/admin mutations: printers upsert (encrypt +
  config-only upsert + maintenance seeding) / delete, queue printed/reset/delete,
  analytics reset, maintenance complete (txn + nozzle reset) / notifications-read /
  intervals PUT, settings PUTs (integrations / public-viewer / analytics-layout /
  printer-card-layout), users CRUD (create / delete / password / role + list), and
  audit-logs GET+POST. Verified by running **Node and Go against two identical
  throwaway DBs** and diffing both HTTP responses and resulting state across ~24 cases
  (validation 400/404/409, success 200/204/201, privileged read-back, seeded
  schedules, and the complete-event transaction incl. the nozzle-reset side effect).
  Bug found & fixed: Go's json.Unmarshal allocates a non-nil zero pointer on a type
  mismatch, so `*bool`/`*string` nil-checks passed where Node's `typeof` rejected —
  the settings PUTs now decode into a generic map and assert the JSON type. Deferred:
  branding PUT (SVG theme analysis), slicer-keys, Discord notifications, home-assistant,
  saml/oauth settings writes, manager (their own phases). queue submit = Phase 5,
  printer command = Phase 6.
- **Phase 5 — done & verified.** Queue intake & files: `POST /api/queue/submit` (public
  multipart intake, busboy replaced by a streaming `mime/multipart` reader that buffers
  the single uploaded file bounded by `QUEUE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`, stores it as
  `queue_jobs.file_content` bytea + `file_mime`/`file_size_bytes`, and fires the Discord
  `queue_added` webhook in a detached goroutine) and `GET /api/queue/:id/file` (streams the
  bytea out in 256 KB chunks read straight from Postgres via `substring`, with the
  `Content-Disposition` attachment/inline + sanitized filename). Both routes are public
  (submit is in `publicAPIMutations`; the file GET is a plain read), wired via
  `handleQueueIntake` between `handleMutations` and the GET read switch. Verified by running
  **Node and Go against two identical throwaway DBs** (Node-dumped schema loaded into the Go
  DB, since the Go server doesn't run `ensureSchema` yet) and diffing responses + DB state:
  the four validation paths (no-name/no-file/bad-ext/empty-file 400/415), the 201 `{ok,id}`
  success shape, download headers (Content-Type/Length/Disposition/Cache-Control), body
  byte-equality (upload↔download↔cross-runtime), full DB row parity (filename, counts,
  notes assembly, priority/estimated_time defaults, form_type, mime, sizes), inline `?open=1`
  disposition, filename sanitization (`my odd@name#2.stl` → `my odd_name_2.stl`), explicit
  mime passthrough, and 404 for a missing file. Bug found & fixed: busboy's `fileSize` limit
  is **inclusive** (a file that reaches `limit` bytes is rejected; max accepted is
  `limit-1`) — confirmed against Node at the 998/999/1000/1001 boundary — so the Go check is
  `>=` not `>`. The `id` (sha1 of `submittedAt.toISOString()|studentId||name|filename`) is
  non-deterministic across runs by design, so it's structure-normalized (`queue-<HEX16>`)
  rather than byte-compared.
- **Phase 6 — done & verified.** Printer hardware: the raw HTTP passthrough
  (`handlePrinterProxy` in `cmd/web/proxy.go`, backing `/__printer_proxy/` and
  `/__printer_webcam/`, plus the friendly `/webcam/<id-or-name>` URL), and the Bambu MQTT
  command surface (`POST /api/printers/:id/command` in `cmd/web/command.go` — all payload
  builders + validators + a short-lived publish-only TLS publish via paho). Wired into
  `handleRequest` after `handleAPI`; the command route is added to `handleMutations` (gated
  operator, as before). The proxy uses a no-timeout `http.Client` (webcam can be an endless
  MJPEG stream) and aborts the upstream via the request context on client disconnect; webcam
  responses get the relaxed headers (WEBCAM_CSP, X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN, CORP
  cross-origin, no-store) and the HTML style-injection. The `api_key_header` is parsed
  exactly like `parseHeaderString` (`Name: value` → that header; bare value → X-API-Key).
  **Bambu cameras (A1/P1 port-6000 JPEG snapshot, H2 RTSP hub) are deferred to Phase 7** —
  a Bambu webcam request hits a Phase-7 stub. Verified Node vs Go against throwaway DBs with
  a fake upstream HTTP printer + a real TLS mosquitto broker: proxy passthrough byte-identical
  (method/path/query/forwarded headers/api-key injection/request body/upstream status);
  webcam passthrough byte-identical (HTML `<style>` injection before `</head>`, all relaxed
  headers, JPEG piped unchanged, `/webcam/<name>` case-insensitive resolution); command
  gate (401)/404/15 validation-error messages byte-identical; and **22 success command
  payloads captured off the broker byte-identical incl. JSON key order** (print actions with
  the stop `param`, gcode_line for temp/gcode/fan, set_airduct with default submode -1, AMS
  load/unload/setting with the ams_id/tray_id split, and the H2 dual-LED light). Bug found &
  fixed: an unsupported-command error interpolates the raw value JS-style, so a missing/
  non-string command must render `undefined`/`null` (Go now uses `commandDisplay`, not the
  empty asserted string). Note: MQTT connection-failure messages differ by library (Node
  "connack timeout" vs Go "i/o timeout") — both 500; not parity-comparable. No `API.md`
  change (pure port).

## Phased plan (each phase build + parity-verify + commit)

1. **Foundation** — server, pgxpool, logger, X-Request-Id, setSecurityHeaders
   (CSP/HSTS/etc.), `/healthz`, `/readyz` (pingDatabase + redis-degraded),
   `/metrics` (printfarm_web_* request metrics), static SPA serving from `/dist`.
2. **Public reads** — `GET /api/printers` (+ viewer redaction), `GET /api/printers/:id`,
   `GET /api/queue`, `GET /api/analytics/daily`, `GET /api/cameras/health`,
   `GET /api/maintenance*` (→ Phase 2b), settings/branding/layout reads.
3. **Sessions & auth** — `/api/auth/*` (login/logout/me), session cookie
   (SameSite=Lax), scrypt password verify (`pwcrypto`), role gate
   (`classifyApiRequest`), CSRF same-origin check, admin credential first-run.
4. **Operator/admin mutations** — printers upsert/delete, queue printed/reset/
   delete, analytics reset, maintenance complete, users CRUD, slicer-keys,
   notifications, audit-logs, settings writes.
5. **Queue intake & files** — `POST /api/queue/submit` (multipart via mime/
   multipart, the busboy replacement), `GET /api/queue/:id/file` bytea stream.
6. **Printer hardware** — `/__printer_proxy/*` (HTTP passthrough),
   `POST /api/printers/:id/command` (Bambu MQTT), `/__printer_webcam/*`.
7. **Camera hub** — port `bambuCamera.js` (persistent ffmpeg RTSP→MJPEG fan-out +
   health supervisor) and `captureBambuSnapshot` (port-6000 TLS JPEG). Highest risk.
8. **SAML SSO** — SP metadata, `/launch`, ACS POST, signed-assertion verification
   (XML c14n + RSA-SHA256 signature check). High risk; needs a real IdP to verify.
9. **/api/v1 data API** — key-gated full read/write parity (`handleDataApi*`),
   audit `source='api'`, no redaction, migration routes.
10. **Manager request API** (`/api/manager/*`, CORS) and remaining edges.
11. **Cutover** — swap compose `web` to Dockerfile.go (needs ffmpeg + ca-certs in
    the runtime image — distroless/static has ca-certs but **not ffmpeg**, so the
    web image needs a different base, e.g. debian-slim + ffmpeg, not distroless).

## Known risk / parity notes

- **CSP/HSTS live in the app**, not nginx — must reproduce `setSecurityHeaders`
  exactly (nginx also sets 4 legacy headers; duplicates are fine).
- **`/metrics` is internal-only** (nginx 404s it publicly); Prometheus scrapes
  `web:5173` directly — keep the same.
- Password hashes: scrypt (`scrypt$…`) with legacy bare-sha256 upgraded on verify.
- JSONB/response shapes must match the frontend exactly (camelCase, nesting).
- The camera hub holds **one ffmpeg per printer** — the web runtime image must
  ship ffmpeg, so it can't be distroless/static like the poller/exporter.
- SAML signature verification has no pure-stdlib path; needs an XML-dsig impl.
